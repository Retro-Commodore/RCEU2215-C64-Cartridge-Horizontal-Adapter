# Cartridge horizontal adapter
Cartrdige vertical to horizontal adapter, i.e. for C128DCR and 1541 Ultimate


This is an adapter I created for my Commodore 128 DCR and 1541 Ultimate 2(+).
I got annoyed that the C128 would reset by cables and the back wall, on the reset switch of any cart with a reset button, due to it's limited space up against the back wall. 
Also the IEC cable connectors would cross tightly and strain the connectors on both IEC and U2 ports. 
The U2+ IEC got moved back in this new design, but not enough, and now the tape connector + audio connectors are in the way.

The result was to make this adapter, 2 nylon standoffs, a cartridge connector and this pcb is all that is needed to fix this problem.
